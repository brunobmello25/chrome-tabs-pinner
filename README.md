# chrome-tabs-pinner

a stupid simple WIP chrome extension to facilitate creating multiple pinned chrome tabs

I constantly have 5 chrome tabs pinned in order: personal calendar, work calendar, evernote, todoist and jira. Since I don't really like chrome's open last tabs feature and couldn't find an extension that does this for me I decided to make my own.

 This is definitely not production ready. I haven't even published it, I just install manually as a development extension. But it's enough for now.
